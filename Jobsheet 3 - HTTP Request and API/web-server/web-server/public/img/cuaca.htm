Its main goal is to simplify interactions between clients and servers by providing a consistent, resource-based approach to accessing and manipulating data. \n\nREST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are defined by two key principles: client-server architecture and statelessness. \n\nLet’s take a deep dive into each of these principles one-by-one. \n\n### Client-server architecture \n\nIn the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other. This means that the code on the client side can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server, and the code on the server side can be changed without affecting the operation of the client. \n\nAs long as each side knows what format of messages to send to the other, they can be kept modular and separate. Separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the flexibility of the interface across platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components. Additionally, the separation provides each component with the ability to evolve independently. \n\nBy using a REST interface, different clients hit the same REST endpoints, perform the same actions, and receive the same responses.  \n\n### Statelessness \n\nSystems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa. In this way, both the server and the client can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages. This constraint of statelessness is enforced through the use of _resources_, rather than _commands_. Resources are the nouns of the Web - they describe any object, document, or _thing_ that you may need to store or send to other services. \n\nThese constraints help RESTful applications achieve reliability, performance, and scalability by ensuring that components can be managed, updated, and reused without disrupting the overall system, even during operation. \n\nNext, let’s discuss what a [REST API](/article/what-is-rest) is and how it works. \n\n## What is a REST API? \n\nA REST API (Application [Programming](/article/what-is-programming) Interface), also known as a RESTful API, is a way for applications to interact with each other over the web following REST principles. It provides a structured method for accessing and manipulating resources—such as users, products, or documents—using standardized [HTTP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http) methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`).  \n\nIn a REST API, each resource is identified by a unique [URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/uri), and data is typically exchanged in lightweight formats such as [JSON](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/json) or [XML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/xml). The API acts as a contract between the client and the server, ensuring that requests are well-formed and responses are predictable. This consistency allows developers to integrate systems more easily, scale applications, and maintain a clear separation between frontend clients and backend services. \n\nHere is a visual representation of how the REST API works: \n\n![REST API model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/articles/0b631b51723fbb3cc652ef5f009082aa71916e63/images/rest_api.svg) \n\nNow, we’ll explore how client-server communication takes place when we are implementing a RESTful interface. \n\n## Client-server communication in REST \n\nIn the REST architecture, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, and servers send responses to these requests. Let’s take a look at the standard ways to make requests and send responses. \n\n### Making requests \n\nREST requires that a client make a request to the server in order to retrieve or modify data on the server. A request generally consists of: \n\n- An HTTP verb, which defines what kind of operation to perform \n- A _header_, which allows the client to pass along information about the request  \n- A path to a resource \n- An optional message body containing data \n\n#### HTTP verbs \n\nThere are four basic HTTP verbs we use in requests to interact with resources in a REST system: \n\n- `GET`: Retrieves a specific resource (by ID) or a collection of resources \n- `POST`: Creates a new resource \n- `PUT`: Updates a specific resource (by ID) \n- `DELETE`: Removes a specific resource (by ID) \n\n#### Headers and Accept parameters \n\nIn the header of the request, the client sends the type of content that it is able to receive from the server. This is called the `Accept` field, and it ensures that the server does not send data that cannot be understood or processed by the client. The options for types of content are MIME Types (or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). They are used to specify the content types in the `Accept` field, including a `type` and a `subtype`. They are separated by a slash (`/`).  \n\nFor example, a text file containing HTML would be specified with the type `text/html`. If this text file contained CSS instead, it would be specified as `text/css`. A generic text file would be denoted as `text/plain`. This default value, `text/plain`, is not a catch-all, however. If a client is expecting `text/css` and receives `text/plain`, it will not be able to recognize the content. \n\nOther types and commonly used subtypes: \n\n- `image`: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif` \n- `audio`: `audio/wav`, `audio/mpeg` \n- `video`: `video/mp4`, `video/ogg` \n- `application`: `application/json`, `application/pdf`, `application/xml`, `application/octet-stream` \n\nFor example, a client accessing a resource with an `id` of `23` in an `articles` resource on a server might send a `GET` request like this: \n\n``` \nGET /articles/23 \nAccept: text/html, application/xhtml \n``` \n\nThe `Accept` header field, in this case says that the client will accept the content in `text/html` or `application/xhtml`. \n\n#### Paths \n\nRequests must contain a path to a resource that the operation should be performed on. In RESTful APIs, paths should be designed to help the client know what is going on.  \n\nConventionally, the first part of the path should be the plural form of the resource. This keeps nested paths simple to read and easy to understand. \n\nA path like `fashionboutique.com/customers/223/orders/12` is clear in what it points to, even if you’ve never seen this specific path before, because it is hierarchical and descriptive. We can see that we are accessing the order with an `id` of `12` for the customer with an `id` of `223`. \n\nPaths should contain the information necessary to locate a resource with the degree of specificity needed. When referring to a list or collection of resources, it is not always necessary to add an `id`. For example, a `POST` request to the `fashionboutique.com/customers` path would not need an extra identifier, as the server will generate an `id` for the new object.  \n\nIf we are trying to access a single resource, we would need to append an `id` to the path. \n\nFor example: \n\n- `GET fashionboutique.com/customers/:id`: Retrieves the item in the `customers` resource with the `id` specified. \n- `DELETE fashionboutique.com/customers/:id`: Deletes the item in the `customers` resource with the `id` specified. \n\n### Sending responses \n\nWhen a client makes a request to a RESTful API, the server must send back a response that clearly communicates both the outcome of the request and the format of any data returned. Responses typically include headers, which provide metadata such as content type and status codes, and may also include a body, which contains the requested resource data. Understanding how servers send responses is crucial for building reliable client-server interactions. \n\n#### Content types \n\nIn cases where the server is sending a data payload to the client, the server must include a `content-type` in the header of the response. This `content-type` header field alerts the client to the type of data it is sending in the response body. These content types are MIME Types, just as they are in the `accept` field of the request header. The `content-type` that the server sends back in the response should be one of the options that the client specified in the `accept` field of the request.  \n\nFor example, when a client is accessing a resource with `id` 23 in an `articles` resource with this GET Request: \n\n``` \nGET /articles/23 HTTP/1.1 \nAccept: text/html, application/xhtml \n``` \n\nThe server might send back the content with the response header: \n\n``` \nHTTP/1.1 200 (OK) \nContent-Type: text/html \n``` \n\nThis would signify that the content requested is being returned in the response body with a `content-type` of `text/html`, which the client said it would be able to accept. \n\n#### Response codes \n\nResponses from the server contain status codes to alert the client to information about the success of the operation. As a developer, you do not need to know every status code, but you should know the most common ones and how they are used: \n\n| Status code                 | Meaning                                                                                                           | \n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| \n| `200 (OK)`                    | This is the standard response for successful [HTTP requests](/article/http-requests).                                                       | \n| `201 (CREATED)`               | This is the standard response for an HTTP request that resulted in an item being successfully created.            | \n| `204 (NO CONTENT)`            | This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests, where nothing is being returned in the response body. | \n| `400 (BAD REQUEST)`           | The request cannot be processed because of bad request syntax, excessive size, or another client error.           | \n| `403 (FORBIDDEN)`             | The client does not have permission to access this resource.                                                      | \n| `404 (NOT FOUND)`             | The resource could not be found at this time. It is possible it was deleted, or does not exist yet.               | \n| `500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)` | The generic answer for an unexpected failure if there is no more specific information available.                  | \n\nFor each HTTP verb, there are expected status codes a server should return upon success: \n\n- `GET`: Return `200 (OK)` \n- `POST`: Return `201 (CREATED)` \n- `PUT`: Return `200 (OK)` \n- `DELETE`: Return `204 (NO CONTENT)` \n\nIf the operation fails, return the most specific status code possible corresponding to the problem that was encountered.    \n\n#### Examples of requests and responses  \n\nLet&apos;s say we have an application that allows you to view, create, edit, and delete customers and orders for a small clothing store hosted at `fashionboutique.com`. We could create an HTTP API that allows a client to perform these functions: \n\nIf we wanted to view all customers, the request would look like this: \n\n``` \nGET http://fashionboutique.com/customers \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\nA possible response header would look like: \n\n``` \nStatus Code: 200 (OK) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\nFollowed by the `customers` data requested in `application/json` format. \n\nCreate a new customer by posting the data: \n\n``` \nPOST http://fashionboutique.com/customers \nBody: \n{ \n  “customer”: { \n    “name” = “Scylla Buss”, \n    “email” = “scylla.buss@codecademy.org” \n  } \n} \n``` \n\nThe server then generates an `id` for that object and returns it back to the client, with a header like: \n\n``` \n201 (CREATED) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\nTo view a single customer, we `GET` it by specifying that customer’s ID: \n\n``` \nGET http://fashionboutique.com/customers/123 \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\nA possible response header would look like: \n\n``` \nStatus Code: 200 (OK) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\nFollowed by the data for the `customer` resource with `id` 23 in `application/json` format. \n\nWe can update that customer by inserting the new data using _PUT_: \n\n``` \nPUT http://fashionboutique.com/customers/123 \nBody: \n{ \n  “customer”: { \n    “name” = “Scylla Buss”, \n    “email” = “scyllabuss1@codecademy.com” \n  } \n} \n``` \n\nA possible response header would have `Status Code: 200 (OK)`, to notify the client that the item with an `id` of `123` has been modified. \n\nWe can also `DELETE` that customer by specifying its `id`: \n\n``` \nDELETE http://fashionboutique.com/customers/123 \n``` \n\nThe response would have a header containing `Status Code: 204 (NO CONTENT)`, notifying the client that the item with an `id` of `123` has been deleted, and nothing in the body. \n\nWith client-server communication covered, let’s learn how to design a REST system. \n\n## Designing a REST system \n\nLet’s imagine we are building a photo collection site. We want to make an API to keep track of users, venues, and photos of those venues. This site has an `index.html` and a `style.css`. Each user has a username and a password. Each photo has a venue and an owner (i.e. the user who took the picture). Each venue has a name and street address. \n\nWe need to design a REST system that would accommodate: \n\n- Storing users, photos, and venues \n- Accessing venues and accessing certain photos of a certain venue  \n\nStart by writing out: \n\n- What kinds of requests we would want to make \n- What responses the server should return \n- What the `content-type` of each response should be \n\n### Possible solution: Models \n\n**User model representing application users:**   \n\n```\n{ \n  “user”: { \n    &quot;id&quot;: &lt;Integer&gt;, \n    “username”: &lt;String&gt;, \n    “password”:  &lt;String&gt; \n  } \n} \n``` \n\n**Photo model representing uploaded venue photos:** \n\n``` \n{ \n  “photo”: { \n    &quot;id&quot;: &lt;Integer&gt;, \n    “venue_id”: &lt;Integer&gt;, \n    “author_id”: &lt;Integer&gt; \n  } \n} \n``` \n\n**Venue model representing venues in the system:** \n\n``` \n{ \n  “venue”: { \n    &quot;id&quot;: &lt;Integer&gt;, \n    “name”: &lt;String&gt;, \n    “address”: &lt;String&gt; \n  } \n} \n``` \n\n### Possible solution: Requests/Responses \n\n#### GET requests \n\n**Requesting the homepage (`index.html`):** \n\n``` \nGET /index.html \nAccept: text/html \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: text/html \n``` \n\n**Requesting the stylesheet (`style.css`):**   \n\n``` \nGET /style.css \nAccept: text/css \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: text/css \n``` \n\n**Fetching all venues:** \n\n``` \nGET /venues \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n**Fetching a single venue by ID:** \n\n``` \nGET /venues/:id \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n**Fetching a specific photo of a venue:**   \n\n``` \nGET /venues/:id/photos/:id \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: image/png \n``` \n\n#### POST requests \n\n**Creating a new user:**   \n\n``` \nPOST /users \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n201 (CREATED) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n**Creating a new venue:** \n\n``` \nPOST /venues \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n201 (CREATED) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n**Uploading a new photo for a venue:** \n\n``` \nPOST /venues/:id/photos \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n201 (CREATED) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n#### PUT requests \n\n**Updating a user by ID:** \n\n``` \nPUT /users/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \n``` \n\n**Updating a venue by ID:** \n\n``` \nPUT /venues/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \n``` \n\n**Updating a photo of a venue:** \n\n``` \nPUT /venues/:id/photos/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \n``` \n\n#### DELETE requests \n\n**Deleting a venue by ID:**   \n\n``` \nDELETE /venues/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n204 (NO CONTENT) \n``` \n\n**Deleting a specific photo of a venue:** \n\n``` \nDELETE /venues/:id/photos/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n204 (NO CONTENT) \n``` \n\nFinally, let’s discuss the advantages and disadvantages of REST. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of REST \n\nREST offers several advantages, including:  \n\n- **Simplicity**: Relies on widely understood HTTP methods and status codes.    \n- **Scalability**: Statelessness allows easy horizontal scaling.    \n- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple data formats (JSON, XML, etc.).    \n- **Inter-operability**: Standardized approach across diverse systems.    \n\nHowever, there are some disadvantages as well:  \n\n- **Over-fetching/Under-fetching**: Clients may receive too much or too little data.    \n- **Performance limitations**: Multiple requests may be required to retrieve related resources.    \n- **Lack of strict standards**: Different implementations may vary, causing inconsistencies. \n- **Not always efficient for complex interactions**: Alternatives like [GraphQL](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/graphql) may be better in some cases. \n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn this tutorial, we explored what REST is, how clients and servers communicate in it, and how a REST system can be designed for real-world applications such as users, venues, and photos. We also discussed REST APIs and looked at the advantages and disadvantages of REST to get an idea of how to use it effectively. \n\nREST has become a cornerstone of web services, enabling simple, scalable, and flexible communication between clients and servers. While REST is not without drawbacks, its widespread adoption and ease of use make it an essential concept for any developer working with distributed systems. As technology evolves, REST continues to be a reliable and adaptable choice for building robust web services. \n\nIf you are interested in learning how to create REST APIs, check out the [Create REST APIs with Spring and Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/create-rest-apis-with-spring-and-java) course on Codecademy. \n\n## Frequently asked questions \n\n### 1. What do you mean by REST API? \n\nA REST API is a special kind of interface that enables clients and servers to communicate using a set of REST principles based on HTTP methods, statelessness, and resource representation. It exposes resources through endpoints, usually returning data in formats like JSON or XML.   \n\n### 2. What’s the difference between API and REST API? \n\nAn API is a general term that refers to any interface that allows software applications to communicate with each other. A REST API is a particular type of API that follows REST principles—using HTTP methods, stateless communication, and resource-based endpoints. In short, all REST APIs are APIs, but not all APIs are REST APIs.   \n\n### 3. Is REST API just HTTP? \n\nNo. REST is an architectural style, not a protocol. While most REST APIs use HTTP as the transport protocol, REST principles can be applied over other protocols too. However, HTTP has become the most common choice due to its simplicity and wide adoption.   \n\n### 4. Do all REST APIs use JSON? \n\nNo. JSON is the most popular format because it is lightweight, easy to read, and well-supported by modern programming languages. However, REST APIs can return other formats such as XML, YAML, or even plain text, depending on the client’s `Accept` header and the server’s implementation.   \n\n### 5. Do REST APIs use XML? \n\nYes, REST APIs can use XML. In fact, before JSON became dominant, XML was widely used as the standard data format for REST APIs. While JSON is now more common, some APIs still support XML, particularly in enterprise or legacy systems.","wordCount":2858,"author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Codecademy","sameAs":"https://www.codecademy.com/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Codecademy","sameAs":"https://www.codecademy.com/"}}</script><meta content="Learn what REST is and how REST APIs enable client-server communication.

<p class="g-md-p">REST (Representational State Transfer) is a well-known architectural style used for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. Its main goal is to simplify interactions between clients and servers by providing a consistent, resource-based approach to accessing and manipulating data. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are defined by two key principles: client-server architecture and statelessness. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">Let’s take a deep dive into each of these principles one-by-one. </p>

<p class="g-md-p">In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other. This means that the code on the client side can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server, and the code on the server side can be changed without affecting the operation of the client. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">As long as each side knows what format of messages to send to the other, they can be kept modular and separate. Separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the flexibility of the interface across platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components. Additionally, the separation provides each component with the ability to evolve independently. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">By using a REST interface, different clients hit the same REST endpoints, perform the same actions, and receive the same responses.  </p>
<h3 id="heading-statelessness" class="g-md-h3 gamut-t98mq7-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Statelessness</h3>
<p class="g-md-p">Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa. In this way, both the server and the client can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages. This constraint of statelessness is enforced through the use of <em class="g-md-em">resources</em>, rather than <em class="g-md-em">commands</em>. Resources are the nouns of the Web - they describe any object, document, or <em class="g-md-em">thing</em> that you may need to store or send to other services. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">These constraints help RESTful applications achieve reliability, performance, and scalability by ensuring that components can be managed, updated, and reused without disrupting the overall system, even during operation. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">Next, let’s discuss what a <a data-testid="domain-agnostic-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-rest" target="_blank" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0">REST API</a> is and how it works. </p>
<h2 id="heading-what-is-a-rest-api" class="g-md-h2 gamut-tbxd0s-StyledText e8i0p5k0">What is a REST API?</h2>
<p class="g-md-p">A REST API (Application <a data-testid="domain-agnostic-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-programming" target="_blank" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0">Programming</a> Interface), also known as a RESTful API, is a way for applications to interact with each other over the web following REST principles. It provides a structured method for accessing and manipulating resources—such as users, products, or documents—using standardized <a data-testid="domain-agnostic-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0">HTTP</a> methods (<code class="g-md-code">GET</code>, <code class="g-md-code">POST</code>, <code class="g-md-code">PUT</code>, and <code class="g-md-code">DELETE</code>).  </p>
<p class="g-md-p">In a REST API, each resource is identified by a unique <a data-testid="domain-agnostic-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/uri" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0">URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)</a>, and data is typically exchanged in lightweight formats such as <a data-testid="domain-agnostic-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/json" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0">JSON</a> or <a data-testid="domain-agnostic-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0">XML</a>. The API acts as a contract between the client and the server, ensuring that requests are well-formed and responses are predictable. This consistency allows developers to integrate systems more easily, scale applications, and maintain a clear separation between frontend clients and backend services. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">Here is a visual representation of how the REST API works: </p>
<p class="g-md-p"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/articles/0b631b51723fbb3cc652ef5f009082aa71916e63/images/rest_api.svg" alt="REST API model" class="g-md-img"/> </p>
<p class="g-md-p">Now, we’ll explore how client-server communication takes place when we are implementing a RESTful interface. </p>
<h2 id="heading-client-server-communication-in-rest" class="g-md-h2 gamut-tbxd0s-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Client-server communication in REST</h2>
<p class="g-md-p">In the REST architecture, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, and servers send responses to these requests. Let’s take a look at the standard ways to make requests and send responses. </p>
<h3 id="heading-making-requests" class="g-md-h3 gamut-t98mq7-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Making requests</h3>
<p class="g-md-p">REST requires that a client make a request to the server in order to retrieve or modify data on the server. A request generally consists of: </p>
<ul class="g-md-ul">
<li class="g-md-li">An HTTP verb, which defines what kind of operation to perform </li>
<li class="g-md-li">A <em class="g-md-em">header</em>, which allows the client to pass along information about the request  </li>
<li class="g-md-li">A path to a resource </li>
<li class="g-md-li">An optional message body containing data</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="heading-http-verbs" class="g-md-h4 gamut-1tvktul-StyledText e8i0p5k0">HTTP verbs</h4>
<p class="g-md-p">There are four basic HTTP verbs we use in requests to interact with resources in a REST system: </p>
<ul class="g-md-ul">
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">GET</code>: Retrieves a specific resource (by ID) or a collection of resources </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">POST</code>: Creates a new resource </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">PUT</code>: Updates a specific resource (by ID) </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">DELETE</code>: Removes a specific resource (by ID)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="heading-headers-and-accept-parameters" class="g-md-h4 gamut-1tvktul-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Headers and Accept parameters</h4>
<p class="g-md-p">In the header of the request, the client sends the type of content that it is able to receive from the server. This is called the <code class="g-md-code">Accept</code> field, and it ensures that the server does not send data that cannot be understood or processed by the client. The options for types of content are MIME Types (or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). They are used to specify the content types in the <code class="g-md-code">Accept</code> field, including a <code class="g-md-code">type</code> and a <code class="g-md-code">subtype</code>. They are separated by a slash (<code class="g-md-code">/</code>).  </p>
<p class="g-md-p">For example, a text file containing HTML would be specified with the type <code class="g-md-code">text/html</code>. If this text file contained CSS instead, it would be specified as <code class="g-md-code">text/css</code>. A generic text file would be denoted as <code class="g-md-code">text/plain</code>. This default value, <code class="g-md-code">text/plain</code>, is not a catch-all, however. If a client is expecting <code class="g-md-code">text/css</code> and receives <code class="g-md-code">text/plain</code>, it will not be able to recognize the content. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">Other types and commonly used subtypes: </p>
<ul class="g-md-ul">
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">image</code>: <code class="g-md-code">image/png</code>, <code class="g-md-code">image/jpeg</code>, <code class="g-md-code">image/gif</code> </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">audio</code>: <code class="g-md-code">audio/wav</code>, <code class="g-md-code">audio/mpeg</code> </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">video</code>: <code class="g-md-code">video/mp4</code>, <code class="g-md-code">video/ogg</code> </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">application</code>: <code class="g-md-code">application/json</code>, <code class="g-md-code">application/pdf</code>, <code class="g-md-code">application/xml</code>, <code class="g-md-code">application/octet-stream</code></li>
</ul>
<p class="g-md-p">For example, a client accessing a resource with an <code class="g-md-code">id</code> of <code class="g-md-code">23</code> in an <code class="g-md-code">articles</code> resource on a server might send a <code class="g-md-code">GET</code> request like this: </p>
<pre class="g-md-pre"><code class="gamut-2iix06-StyledText e8i0p5k0">GET /articles/23 
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml 
</code></pre>
<p class="g-md-p">The <code class="g-md-code">Accept</code> header field, in this case says that the client will accept the content in <code class="g-md-code">text/html</code> or <code class="g-md-code">application/xhtml</code>. </p>
<h4 id="heading-paths" class="g-md-h4 gamut-1tvktul-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Paths</h4>
<p class="g-md-p">Requests must contain a path to a resource that the operation should be performed on. In RESTful APIs, paths should be designed to help the client know what is going on.  </p>
<p class="g-md-p">Conventionally, the first part of the path should be the plural form of the resource. This keeps nested paths simple to read and easy to understand. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">A path like <code class="g-md-code">fashionboutique.com/customers/223/orders/12</code> is clear in what it points to, even if you’ve never seen this specific path before, because it is hierarchical and descriptive. We can see that we are accessing the order with an <code class="g-md-code">id</code> of <code class="g-md-code">12</code> for the customer with an <code class="g-md-code">id</code> of <code class="g-md-code">223</code>. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">Paths should contain the information necessary to locate a resource with the degree of specificity needed. When referring to a list or collection of resources, it is not always necessary to add an <code class="g-md-code">id</code>. For example, a <code class="g-md-code">POST</code> request to the <code class="g-md-code">fashionboutique.com/customers</code> path would not need an extra identifier, as the server will generate an <code class="g-md-code">id</code> for the new object.  </p>
<p class="g-md-p">If we are trying to access a single resource, we would need to append an <code class="g-md-code">id</code> to the path. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">For example: </p>
<ul class="g-md-ul">
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">GET fashionboutique.com/customers/:id</code>: Retrieves the item in the <code class="g-md-code">customers</code> resource with the <code class="g-md-code">id</code> specified. </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><code class="g-md-code">DELETE fashionboutique.com/customers/:id</code>: Deletes the item in the <code class="g-md-code">customers</code> resource with the <code class="g-md-code">id</code> specified.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heading-sending-responses" class="g-md-h3 gamut-t98mq7-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Sending responses</h3>
<p class="g-md-p">When a client makes a request to a RESTful API, the server must send back a response that clearly communicates both the outcome of the request and the format of any data returned. Responses typically include headers, which provide metadata such as content type and status codes, and may also include a body, which contains the requested resource data. Understanding how servers send responses is crucial for building reliable client-server interactions. </p>
<h4 id="heading-content-types" class="g-md-h4 gamut-1tvktul-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Content types</h4>
<p class="g-md-p">In cases where the server is sending a data payload to the client, the server must include a <code class="g-md-code">content-type</code> in the header of the response. This <code class="g-md-code">content-type</code> header field alerts the client to the type of data it is sending in the response body. These content types are MIME Types, just as they are in the <code class="g-md-code">accept</code> field of the request header. The <code class="g-md-code">content-type</code> that the server sends back in the response should be one of the options that the client specified in the <code class="g-md-code">accept</code> field of the request.  </p>
<p class="g-md-p">For example, when a client is accessing a resource with <code class="g-md-code">id</code> 23 in an <code class="g-md-code">articles</code> resource with this GET Request: </p>
<pre class="g-md-pre"><code class="gamut-2iix06-StyledText e8i0p5k0">GET /articles/23 HTTP/1.1 
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml 
</code></pre>
<p class="g-md-p">The server might send back the content with the response header: </p>
<pre class="g-md-pre"><code class="gamut-2iix06-StyledText e8i0p5k0">HTTP/1.1 200 (OK) 
Content-Type: text/html 
</code></pre>
<p class="g-md-p">This would signify that the content requested is being returned in the response body with a <code class="g-md-code">content-type</code> of <code class="g-md-code">text/html</code>, which the client said it would be able to accept. </p>
<h4 id="heading-response-codes" class="g-md-h4 gamut-1tvktul-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Response codes</h4>
<p class="g-md-p">Responses from the server contain status codes to alert the client to information about the success of the operation. As a developer, you do not need to know every status code, but you should know the most common ones and how they are used: </p>

<p class="g-md-p">Finally, let’s discuss the advantages and disadvantages of REST. </p>
<h2 id="heading-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-rest" class="g-md-h2 gamut-tbxd0s-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Advantages and disadvantages of REST</h2>
<p class="g-md-p">REST offers several advantages, including:  </p>
<ul class="g-md-ul">
<li class="g-md-li"><strong class="g-md-strong">Simplicity</strong>: Relies on widely understood HTTP methods and status codes.    </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><strong class="g-md-strong">Scalability</strong>: Statelessness allows easy horizontal scaling.    </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><strong class="g-md-strong">Flexibility</strong>: Supports multiple data formats (JSON, XML, etc.).    </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><strong class="g-md-strong">Inter-operability</strong>: Standardized approach across diverse systems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="g-md-p">However, there are some disadvantages as well:  </p>
<ul class="g-md-ul">
<li class="g-md-li"><strong class="g-md-strong">Over-fetching/Under-fetching</strong>: Clients may receive too much or too little data.    </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><strong class="g-md-strong">Performance limitations</strong>: Multiple requests may be required to retrieve related resources.    </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><strong class="g-md-strong">Lack of strict standards</strong>: Different implementations may vary, causing inconsistencies. </li>
<li class="g-md-li"><strong class="g-md-strong">Not always efficient for complex interactions</strong>: Alternatives like <a data-testid="domain-agnostic-link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/graphql" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0">GraphQL</a> may be better in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading-conclusion" class="g-md-h2 gamut-tbxd0s-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="g-md-p">In this tutorial, we explored what REST is, how clients and servers communicate in it, and how a REST system can be designed for real-world applications such as users, venues, and photos. We also discussed REST APIs and looked at the advantages and disadvantages of REST to get an idea of how to use it effectively. </p>
<p class="g-md-p">REST has become a cornerstone of web services, enabling simple, scalable, and flexible communication between clients and servers. While REST is not without drawbacks, its widespread adoption and ease of use make it an essential concept for any developer working with distributed systems. As technology evolves, REST continues to be a reliable and adaptable choice for building robust web services. </p>

<h2 id="heading-frequently-asked-questions" class="g-md-h2 gamut-tbxd0s-StyledText e8i0p5k0">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="heading-1-what-do-you-mean-by-rest-api" class="g-md-h3 gamut-t98mq7-StyledText e8i0p5k0">1. What do you mean by REST API?</h3>
<p class="g-md-p">A REST API is a special kind of interface that enables clients and servers to communicate using a set of REST principles based on HTTP methods, statelessness, and resource representation. It exposes resources through endpoints, usually returning data in formats like JSON or XML.   </p>
<h3 id="heading-2-whats-the-difference-between-api-and-rest-api" class="g-md-h3 gamut-t98mq7-StyledText e8i0p5k0">2. What’s the difference between API and REST API?</h3>
<p class="g-md-p">An API is a general term that refers to any interface that allows software applications to communicate with each other. A REST API is a particular type of API that follows REST principles—using HTTP methods, stateless communication, and resource-based endpoints. In short, all REST APIs are APIs, but not all APIs are REST APIs.   </p>
<h3 id="heading-3-is-rest-api-just-http" class="g-md-h3 gamut-t98mq7-StyledText e8i0p5k0">3. Is REST API just HTTP?</h3>
<p class="g-md-p">No. REST is an architectural style, not a protocol. While most REST APIs use HTTP as the transport protocol, REST principles can be applied over other protocols too. However, HTTP has become the most common choice due to its simplicity and wide adoption.   </p>
<h3 id="heading-4-do-all-rest-apis-use-json" class="g-md-h3 gamut-t98mq7-StyledText e8i0p5k0">4. Do all REST APIs use JSON?</h3>
<p class="g-md-p">No. JSON is the most popular format because it is lightweight, easy to read, and well-supported by modern programming languages. However, REST APIs can return other formats such as XML, YAML, or even plain text, depending on the client’s <code class="g-md-code">Accept</code> header and the server’s implementation.   </p>
<h3 id="heading-5-do-rest-apis-use-xml" class="g-md-h3 gamut-t98mq7-StyledText e8i0p5k0">5. Do REST APIs use XML?</h3>
<p class="g-md-p">Yes, REST APIs can use XML. In fact, before JSON became dominant, XML was widely used as the standard data format for REST APIs. While JSON is now more common, some APIs still support XML, particularly in enterprise or legacy systems.</p>

(Representational State Transfer) is a well-known architectural style used for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. Its main goal is to simplify interactions between clients and servers by providing a consistent, resource-based approach to accessing and manipulating data. \n\nREST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are defined by two key principles: client-server architecture and statelessness. \n\nLet’s take a deep dive into each of these principles one-by-one. \n\n### Client-server architecture \n\nIn the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other. This means that the code on the client side can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server, and the code on the server side can be changed without affecting the operation of the client. \n\nAs long as each side knows what format of messages to send to the other, they can be kept modular and separate. Separating the user interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the flexibility of the interface across platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components. Additionally, the separation provides each component with the ability to evolve independently. \n\nBy using a REST interface, different clients hit the same REST endpoints, perform the same actions, and receive the same responses.  \n\n### Statelessness \n\nSystems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know anything about what state the client is in and vice versa. In this way, both the server and the client can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages. This constraint of statelessness is enforced through the use of _resources_, rather than _commands_. Resources are the nouns of the Web - they describe any object, document, or _thing_ that you may need to store or send to other services. \n\nThese constraints help RESTful applications achieve reliability, performance, and scalability by ensuring that components can be managed, updated, and reused without disrupting the overall system, even during operation. \n\nNext, let’s discuss what a [REST API](/article/what-is-rest) is and how it works. \n\n## What is a REST API? \n\nA REST API (Application [Programming](/article/what-is-programming) Interface), also known as a RESTful API, is a way for applications to interact with each other over the web following REST principles. It provides a structured method for accessing and manipulating resources—such as users, products, or documents—using standardized [HTTP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http) methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`).  \n\nIn a REST API, each resource is identified by a unique [URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/uri), and data is typically exchanged in lightweight formats such as [JSON](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/json) or [XML](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/xml). The API acts as a contract between the client and the server, ensuring that requests are well-formed and responses are predictable. This consistency allows developers to integrate systems more easily, scale applications, and maintain a clear separation between frontend clients and backend services. \n\nHere is a visual representation of how the REST API works: \n\n![REST API model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codecademy/articles/0b631b51723fbb3cc652ef5f009082aa71916e63/images/rest_api.svg) \n\nNow, we’ll explore how client-server communication takes place when we are implementing a RESTful interface. \n\n## Client-server communication in REST \n\nIn the REST architecture, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, and servers send responses to these requests. Let’s take a look at the standard ways to make requests and send responses. \n\n### Making requests \n\nREST requires that a client make a request to the server in order to retrieve or modify data on the server. A request generally consists of: \n\n- An HTTP verb, which defines what kind of operation to perform \n- A _header_, which allows the client to pass along information about the request  \n- A path to a resource \n- An optional message body containing data \n\n#### HTTP verbs \n\nThere are four basic HTTP verbs we use in requests to interact with resources in a REST system: \n\n- `GET`: Retrieves a specific resource (by ID) or a collection of resources \n- `POST`: Creates a new resource \n- `PUT`: Updates a specific resource (by ID) \n- `DELETE`: Removes a specific resource (by ID) \n\n#### Headers and Accept parameters \n\nIn the header of the request, the client sends the type of content that it is able to receive from the server. This is called the `Accept` field, and it ensures that the server does not send data that cannot be understood or processed by the client. The options for types of content are MIME Types (or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). They are used to specify the content types in the `Accept` field, including a `type` and a `subtype`. They are separated by a slash (`/`).  \n\nFor example, a text file containing HTML would be specified with the type `text/html`. If this text file contained CSS instead, it would be specified as `text/css`. A generic text file would be denoted as `text/plain`. This default value, `text/plain`, is not a catch-all, however. If a client is expecting `text/css` and receives `text/plain`, it will not be able to recognize the content. \n\nOther types and commonly used subtypes: \n\n- `image`: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif` \n- `audio`: `audio/wav`, `audio/mpeg` \n- `video`: `video/mp4`, `video/ogg` \n- `application`: `application/json`, `application/pdf`, `application/xml`, `application/octet-stream` \n\nFor example, a client accessing a resource with an `id` of `23` in an `articles` resource on a server might send a `GET` request like this: \n\n``` \nGET /articles/23 \nAccept: text/html, application/xhtml \n``` \n\nThe `Accept` header field, in this case says that the client will accept the content in `text/html` or `application/xhtml`. \n\n#### Paths \n\nRequests must contain a path to a resource that the operation should be performed on. In RESTful APIs, paths should be designed to help the client know what is going on.  \n\nConventionally, the first part of the path should be the plural form of the resource. This keeps nested paths simple to read and easy to understand. \n\nA path like `fashionboutique.com/customers/223/orders/12` is clear in what it points to, even if you’ve never seen this specific path before, because it is hierarchical and descriptive. We can see that we are accessing the order with an `id` of `12` for the customer with an `id` of `223`. \n\nPaths should contain the information necessary to locate a resource with the degree of specificity needed. When referring to a list or collection of resources, it is not always necessary to add an `id`. For example, a `POST` request to the `fashionboutique.com/customers` path would not need an extra identifier, as the server will generate an `id` for the new object.  \n\nIf we are trying to access a single resource, we would need to append an `id` to the path. \n\nFor example: \n\n- `GET fashionboutique.com/customers/:id`: Retrieves the item in the `customers` resource with the `id` specified. \n- `DELETE fashionboutique.com/customers/:id`: Deletes the item in the `customers` resource with the `id` specified. \n\n### Sending responses \n\nWhen a client makes a request to a RESTful API, the server must send back a response that clearly communicates both the outcome of the request and the format of any data returned. Responses typically include headers, which provide metadata such as content type and status codes, and may also include a body, which contains the requested resource data. Understanding how servers send responses is crucial for building reliable client-server interactions. \n\n#### Content types \n\nIn cases where the server is sending a data payload to the client, the server must include a `content-type` in the header of the response. This `content-type` header field alerts the client to the type of data it is sending in the response body. These content types are MIME Types, just as they are in the `accept` field of the request header. The `content-type` that the server sends back in the response should be one of the options that the client specified in the `accept` field of the request.  \n\nFor example, when a client is accessing a resource with `id` 23 in an `articles` resource with this GET Request: \n\n``` \nGET /articles/23 HTTP/1.1 \nAccept: text/html, application/xhtml \n``` \n\nThe server might send back the content with the response header: \n\n``` \nHTTP/1.1 200 (OK) \nContent-Type: text/html \n``` \n\nThis would signify that the content requested is being returned in the response body with a `content-type` of `text/html`, which the client said it would be able to accept. \n\n#### Response codes \n\nResponses from the server contain status codes to alert the client to information about the success of the operation. As a developer, you do not need to know every status code, but you should know the most common ones and how they are used: \n\n| Status code                 | Meaning                                                                                                           | \n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| \n| `200 (OK)`                    | This is the standard response for successful [HTTP requests](/article/http-requests).                                                       | \n| `201 (CREATED)`               | This is the standard response for an HTTP request that resulted in an item being successfully created.            | \n| `204 (NO CONTENT)`            | This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests, where nothing is being returned in the response body. | \n| `400 (BAD REQUEST)`           | The request cannot be processed because of bad request syntax, excessive size, or another client error.           | \n| `403 (FORBIDDEN)`             | The client does not have permission to access this resource.                                                      | \n| `404 (NOT FOUND)`             | The resource could not be found at this time. It is possible it was deleted, or does not exist yet.               | \n| `500 (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR)` | The generic answer for an unexpected failure if there is no more specific information available.                  | \n\nFor each HTTP verb, there are expected status codes a server should return upon success: \n\n- `GET`: Return `200 (OK)` \n- `POST`: Return `201 (CREATED)` \n- `PUT`: Return `200 (OK)` \n- `DELETE`: Return `204 (NO CONTENT)` \n\nIf the operation fails, return the most specific status code possible corresponding to the problem that was encountered.    \n\n#### Examples of requests and responses  \n\nLet's say we have an application that allows you to view, create, edit, and delete customers and orders for a small clothing store hosted at `fashionboutique.com`. We could create an HTTP API that allows a client to perform these functions: \n\nIf we wanted to view all customers, the request would look like this: \n\n``` \nGET http://fashionboutique.com/customers \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\nA possible response header would look like: \n\n``` \nStatus Code: 200 (OK) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\nFollowed by the `customers` data requested in `application/json` format. \n\nCreate a new customer by posting the data: \n\n``` \nPOST http://fashionboutique.com/customers \nBody: \n{ \n  “customer”: { \n    “name” = “Scylla Buss”, \n    “email” = “scylla.buss@codecademy.org” \n  } \n} \n``` \n\nThe server then generates an `id` for that object and returns it back to the client, with a header like: \n\n``` \n201 (CREATED) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\nTo view a single customer, we `GET` it by specifying that customer’s ID: \n\n``` \nGET http://fashionboutique.com/customers/123 \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\nA possible response header would look like: \n\n``` \nStatus Code: 200 (OK) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\nFollowed by the data for the `customer` resource with `id` 23 in `application/json` format. \n\nWe can update that customer by inserting the new data using _PUT_: \n\n``` \nPUT http://fashionboutique.com/customers/123 \nBody: \n{ \n  “customer”: { \n    “name” = “Scylla Buss”, \n    “email” = “scyllabuss1@codecademy.com” \n  } \n} \n``` \n\nA possible response header would have `Status Code: 200 (OK)`, to notify the client that the item with an `id` of `123` has been modified. \n\nWe can also `DELETE` that customer by specifying its `id`: \n\n``` \nDELETE http://fashionboutique.com/customers/123 \n``` \n\nThe response would have a header containing `Status Code: 204 (NO CONTENT)`, notifying the client that the item with an `id` of `123` has been deleted, and nothing in the body. \n\nWith client-server communication covered, let’s learn how to design a REST system. \n\n## Designing a REST system \n\nLet’s imagine we are building a photo collection site. We want to make an API to keep track of users, venues, and photos of those venues. This site has an `index.html` and a `style.css`. Each user has a username and a password. Each photo has a venue and an owner (i.e. the user who took the picture). Each venue has a name and street address. \n\nWe need to design a REST system that would accommodate: \n\n- Storing users, photos, and venues \n- Accessing venues and accessing certain photos of a certain venue  \n\nStart by writing out: \n\n- What kinds of requests we would want to make \n- What responses the server should return \n- What the `content-type` of each response should be \n\n### Possible solution: Models \n\n**User model representing application users:**   \n\n```\n{ \n  “user”: { \n    \"id\": \u003cInteger\u003e, \n    “username”: \u003cString\u003e, \n    “password”:  \u003cString\u003e \n  } \n} \n``` \n\n**Photo model representing uploaded venue photos:** \n\n``` \n{ \n  “photo”: { \n    \"id\": \u003cInteger\u003e, \n    “venue_id”: \u003cInteger\u003e, \n    “author_id”: \u003cInteger\u003e \n  } \n} \n``` \n\n**Venue model representing venues in the system:** \n\n``` \n{ \n  “venue”: { \n    \"id\": \u003cInteger\u003e, \n    “name”: \u003cString\u003e, \n    “address”: \u003cString\u003e \n  } \n} \n``` \n\n### Possible solution: Requests/Responses \n\n#### GET requests \n\n**Requesting the homepage (`index.html`):** \n\n``` \nGET /index.html \nAccept: text/html \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: text/html \n``` \n\n**Requesting the stylesheet (`style.css`):**   \n\n``` \nGET /style.css \nAccept: text/css \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: text/css \n``` \n\n**Fetching all venues:** \n\n``` \nGET /venues \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n**Fetching a single venue by ID:** \n\n``` \nGET /venues/:id \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n**Fetching a specific photo of a venue:**   \n\n``` \nGET /venues/:id/photos/:id \nAccept: application/json \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \nContent-type: image/png \n``` \n\n#### POST requests \n\n**Creating a new user:**   \n\n``` \nPOST /users \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n201 (CREATED) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n**Creating a new venue:** \n\n``` \nPOST /venues \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n201 (CREATED) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n**Uploading a new photo for a venue:** \n\n``` \nPOST /venues/:id/photos \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n201 (CREATED) \nContent-type: application/json \n``` \n\n#### PUT requests \n\n**Updating a user by ID:** \n\n``` \nPUT /users/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \n``` \n\n**Updating a venue by ID:** \n\n``` \nPUT /venues/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \n``` \n\n**Updating a photo of a venue:** \n\n``` \nPUT /venues/:id/photos/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n200 (OK) \n``` \n\n#### DELETE requests \n\n**Deleting a venue by ID:**   \n\n``` \nDELETE /venues/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n204 (NO CONTENT) \n``` \n\n**Deleting a specific photo of a venue:** \n\n``` \nDELETE /venues/:id/photos/:id \n``` \n\n**Response:** \n\n``` \n204 (NO CONTENT) \n``` \n\nFinally, let’s discuss the advantages and disadvantages of REST. \n\n## Advantages and disadvantages of REST \n\nREST offers several advantages, including:  \n\n- **Simplicity**: Relies on widely understood HTTP methods and status codes.    \n- **Scalability**: Statelessness allows easy horizontal scaling.    \n- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple data formats (JSON, XML, etc.).    \n- **Inter-operability**: Standardized approach across diverse systems.    \n\nHowever, there are some disadvantages as well:  \n\n- **Over-fetching/Under-fetching**: Clients may receive too much or too little data.    \n- **Performance limitations**: Multiple requests may be required to retrieve related resources.    \n- **Lack of strict standards**: Different implementations may vary, causing inconsistencies. \n- **Not always efficient for complex interactions**: Alternatives like [GraphQL](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/graphql) may be better in some cases. \n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn this tutorial, we explored what REST is, how clients and servers communicate in it, and how a REST system can be designed for real-world applications such as users, venues, and photos. We also discussed REST APIs and looked at the advantages and disadvantages of REST to get an idea of how to use it effectively. \n\nREST has become a cornerstone of web services, enabling simple, scalable, and flexible communication between clients and servers. While REST is not without drawbacks, its widespread adoption and ease of use make it an essential concept for any developer working with distributed systems. As technology evolves, REST continues to be a reliable and adaptable choice for building robust web services. \n\nIf you are interested in learning how to create REST APIs, check out the [Create REST APIs with Spring and Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/create-rest-apis-with-spring-and-java) course on Codecademy. \n\n## Frequently asked questions \n\n### 1. What do you mean by REST API? \n\nA REST API is a special kind of interface that enables clients and servers to communicate using a set of REST principles based on HTTP methods, statelessness, and resource representation. It exposes resources through endpoints, usually returning data in formats like JSON or XML.   \n\n### 2. What’s the difference between API and REST API? \n\nAn API is a general term that refers to any interface that allows software applications to communicate with each other. A REST API is a particular type of API that follows REST principles—using HTTP methods, stateless communication, and resource-based endpoints. In short, all REST APIs are APIs, but not all APIs are REST APIs.   \n\n### 3. Is REST API just HTTP? \n\nNo. REST is an architectural style, not a protocol. While most REST APIs use HTTP as the transport protocol, REST principles can be applied over other protocols too. However, HTTP has become the most common choice due to its simplicity and wide adoption.   \n\n### 4. Do all REST APIs use JSON? \n\nNo. JSON is the most popular format because it is lightweight, easy to read, and well-supported by modern programming languages. However, REST APIs can return other formats such as XML, YAML, or even plain text, depending on the client’s `Accept` header and the server’s implementation.   \n\n### 5. Do REST APIs use XML? \n\nYes, REST APIs can use XML. In fact, before JSON became dominant, XML was widely used as the standard data format for REST APIs.
